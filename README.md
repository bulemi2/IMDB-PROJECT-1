MICROSOFT MOVIE ANALYSIS  PROJECT 1.

# 1 Overview
# Background of the Business
Microsoft, a technology giant with a strong presence in software, cloud computing, and consumer electronics, is venturing into the entertainment industry by establishing its own movie studio. This strategic move is a response to the growing demand for original video content and the success of tech companies in the entertainment sector. Microsoft recognizes the potential for expansion beyond its traditional tech offerings and aims to leverage its resources and expertise to create compelling and profitable films.
The movie studio will be a part of Microsoft’s broader vision to become a leading provider of digital entertainment and media. Microsoft already has a service called Microsoft Movies & TV that allows users to rent or buy the latest movies and TV shows and watch them using the Movies & TV app, on their Xbox console and their Windows device. The movie studio will produce exclusive content for this platform, as well as for other streaming services and theatrical releases. Microsoft hopes to attract and retain customers by offering them a diverse and high-quality selection of movies and TV shows.
To achieve its goals, Microsoft will leverage its existing strengths and capabilities in the entertainment industry. Microsoft has a software called VEGAS Movie Studio 18 that simplifies sophisticated video editing and provides basic and advanced features for creating movies. Microsoft also used to have a division called Xbox Entertainment Studios that was created in 2012 to produce interactive television content for Xbox Live, but it was shut down in 2014 due to restructuring. Microsoft will use the lessons learned from these ventures, as well as its expertise in technology, innovation, and marketing, to create a successful movie studio that can compete with the established players in the industry.


# Domain of the Business
The domain of Microsoft’s movie studio encompasses the production and distribution of feature films for both traditional cinema and digital streaming platforms. The studio will operate within the broader entertainment and media industry, competing with established film studios and streaming services. Microsoft’s entry into this domain will focus on the creation of diverse, high-quality content, including a mix of genres and innovative storytelling formats, to capture the attention of global audiences.
Some of the genres that Microsoft’s movie studio will explore are sci-fi, fantasy, action, comedy, drama, and animation. The studio will also experiment with interactive and immersive formats, such as virtual reality, augmented reality, and mixed reality, to enhance the viewing experience and engage the viewers in new ways. The studio will collaborate with talented filmmakers, actors, writers, and technicians from around the world to produce original and compelling stories that reflect the diverse cultures and perspectives of the global community. Microsoft’s movie studio will aim to deliver entertaining and inspiring films that appeal to a wide range of audiences and showcase Microsoft’s vision and values.

# 3.Data Understanding

The dataset selected for this project is a rich trove of information revolving around the box office revenues of various films. Within this dataset, a diverse range of variables are meticulously recorded, offering insights into crucial aspects of the film industry. These variables encompass key details such as release dates, genre classifications, production budgets, and the earnings generated by each film at the box office. Our project's fundamental approach revolves around the application of exploratory data analysis (EDA) techniques, serving as the foundation for a profound understanding of the dataset's intricacies.

In the initial phase of our analysis, we delve into data preprocessing tasks essential for ensuring data quality and coherence. This includes addressing any missing values that may exist within the dataset, a critical step to ensure the integrity of our findings. Additionally, we meticulously scrutinize the data types to ensure compatibility with our analytical tools and processes. The detection of outliers and the identification of placeholder values further enhance the data's reliability and accuracy.

As our EDA journey unfolds, we focus on uncovering patterns and relationships hidden within the dataset. By extracting relevant features and delving into the interplay between variables, we aim to unveil actionable insights that will guide our subsequent in-depth analysis. This methodical approach will not only provide a comprehensive snapshot of the film industry's box office dynamics but also lay the groundwork for data-driven decision-making in the world of cinema.


# 5.	Recommendation

 The following are my recommendation from the analysis:
1.	Budget Allocation: Efficient and strategic budget allocation holds paramount importance in the film industry, primarily because larger budgets can significantly enhance production value, thereby attracting a broader viewership base. To make informed decisions regarding the optimal budget for a film project, it is imperative to conduct a comprehensive assessment that encompasses several key factors. Firstly, one must carefully consider the genre of the film, as different genres necessitate varying levels of financial investment to effectively capture their essence and appeal to their respective audiences. Secondly, the target audience should be meticulously identified and analyzed, as their preferences, demographics, and expectations play a pivotal role in determining the budget's allocation across various aspects of production, marketing, and distribution. Lastly, thorough market demand analysis is essential, as it informs budget decisions by gauging the competitive landscape, audience trends, and potential return on investment. By meticulously weighing these factors, a filmmaker or production team can make well-informed choices regarding budget allocation, ultimately optimizing the chances of creating a successful and financially rewarding cinematic endeavor."
2.	Genre Analysis and Targeting: In order to maximize success in the film industry, it's essential to evaluate both the financial potential and audience preferences across various genres and strategically select those that align with the production studio's strengths and consumer demand.
3.	Strategic Release Dates: Prior to scheduling film releases, it is crucial to carefully consider and analyze the prevailing seasonal trends and patterns in box office performance, as these insights can significantly impact a movie's success and profitability. Understanding the ebb and flow of audience preferences throughout the year, including peak movie-going seasons and periods of reduced cinema attendance, can inform strategic decisions related to release dates, marketing campaigns, and resource allocation, ultimately increasing the chances of achieving optimal box office results.
4.	.Collaboration and Partnership: As part of a comprehensive strategy, it is advisable to actively explore opportunities for collaborations and partnerships with well-established studios, renowned directors, industry professionals, and actors who boast a proven track record of consistently delivering successful box office performances. Such strategic alliances not only bring invaluable expertise and experience into your projects but also enhance the overall credibility and marketability of your films. By aligning your endeavors with individuals and entities known for their box office prowess, you can tap into existing fan bases, access wider distribution networks, and substantially increase the potential for achieving remarkable financial success and cultural impact within the ever-competitive film industry.


# 5.Conclusion
From the data analysis i came up with the following conclusions:
1.	A film's budget and income are positively correlated, indicating that higher production costs typically result in better returns.
2.	Certain studios consistently generate higher revenues indicating their strong position in the industry. This can help Microsoft make informed decisions on competing with the studios best on the production of good genres of movies
3.	Fox has the highest rating in film production compared to other studios. This means Microsoft should study what fox studios do to their best for them to attract those numbers in production of the films
